# Clinical Trial Analysis - Reasoning Model Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to implement OpenAI's reasoning best practices for clinical trial analysis, based on the detailed specifications in `GenAI_Case_Clinical_Trial_Analysis_PROMPT_ver1.00.docx.md`.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. JSON Schema Validation
**Before:** Basic JSON parsing with regex fallback
**After:** Conditional `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` for supported models

```python
# Prepare request parameters
request_params = {
    "model": self.model,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "max_tokens": 1500
}

# Add response_format only for supported models
if self.model in ["gpt-4o", "gpt-4o-mini"]:
    request_params["response_format"] = {"type": "json_object"}

response = self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(**request_params)
```

**Benefits:**
- Ensures valid JSON output for newer models
- Reduces parsing errors
- Maintains compatibility with legacy models

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**Before:** Simple try-catch with basic fallback
**After:** Robust error handling with detailed logging and fallback mechanisms

```python
try:
    result = json.loads(content)
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    logger.error(f"JSON parsing error: {e}")
    logger.error(f"Response content: {content}")
    # Try to extract JSON using regex for older models
    json_match = re.search(r'\{.*\}', content, re.DOTALL)
    if json_match:
        try:
            result = json.loads(json_match.group())
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid JSON response: {e}")
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid JSON response: {e}")
```

**Benefits:**
- Better debugging capabilities
- Graceful degradation for different model responses
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

### 3. Structured Output Definition
**Before:** Generic prompts asking for JSON
**After:** Explicit field definitions with clear structure

```python
prompt = f"""
Return a JSON object with these exact field names: 
"Primary Drug", "Primary Drug MoA", "Primary Drug Target", 
"Primary Drug Modality", "Primary Drug ROA", "Mono/Combo", 
"Combination Partner", "MoA of Combination", "Experimental Regimen", 
"MoA of Experimental Regimen"
"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent output structure
- Clear field expectations
- Easier data processing

### 4. Temperature Control
**Before:** Default temperature settings
**After:** Low temperature (0.1) for consistent reasoning

```python
request_params = {
    "model": self.model,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
    "temperature": 0.1,  # Low temperature for consistent reasoning
    "max_tokens": 1500
}
```

**Benefits:**
- More consistent outputs
- Better adherence to specifications
- Reduced variability in results

### 5. Enhanced Prompt Engineering
**Before:** Basic prompts with minimal context
**After:** Detailed prompts with comprehensive rules and examples

```python
prompt = f"""
ANALYSIS RULES (from GenAI_Case_Clinical_Trial_Analysis_PROMPT_ver1.00.docx.md):

1. PRIMARY DRUG:
   - Identify the primary investigational drug being tested (NOT active comparators)
   - Focus on the trial's main objective and evaluation focus
   - Exclude drugs used as active comparators (e.g., "vs chemo" or "Active Comparator")
   - Do not consider background therapies or standard-of-care agents as primary
   - In novel combinations, consider both drugs as primary (separate rows)
   - Standardize to generic drug name (e.g., "pembrolizumab" not "Keytruda")

2. PRIMARY DRUG MoA:
   - Use standardized format: "Anti-[Target]", "[Target] inhibitor", "[Target] agonist"
   - Examples: "Anti-PD-1", "PARP inhibitor", "GLP-1 Receptor Agonist"
   - For antibodies: "Anti-[Target]" (e.g., "Anti-Nectin-4")
   - For small molecules: "[Target] inhibitor" (e.g., "EGFR inhibitor")
   - For bispecifics: "Anti-[Target] × [Target]" (e.g., "Anti-PD-1 × CTLA-4")

REASONING PROCESS:
1. First, identify all experimental arms and active comparators
2. Determine which drug is the primary investigational agent
3. Analyze the drug's mechanism and properties
4. Determine if it's evaluated as mono or combo therapy
5. Extract combination partners if applicable
6. Apply standardization rules consistently
"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Better understanding of complex rules
- Consistent application of specifications
- Improved accuracy in field extraction

### 6. Model Selection Support
**Before:** Fixed model usage
**After:** Support for multiple reasoning models with conditional features

```python
def __init__(self, openai_api_key: str, model: str = "gpt-4o"):
    """Initialize the analyzer with OpenAI API key and reasoning model"""
    self.openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
    self.model = model  # Use reasoning model like gpt-4o
```

**Supported Models:**
- `gpt-4o` (recommended - best reasoning)
- `gpt-4o-mini` (faster, good reasoning)
- `gpt-4` (legacy, good reasoning)

## Performance Comparison

### Quality Metrics
| Analysis Type | Total Fields | Valid Fields | Error Fields | Quality Score |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Manual Analysis | 40 | 40 | 0 | 100.0% |
| LLM Analysis | 41 | 41 | 0 | 100.0% |
| Reasoning Model | 41 | 34 | 7 | 82.9% |
