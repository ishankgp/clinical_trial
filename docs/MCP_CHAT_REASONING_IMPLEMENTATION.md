## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **MCP Chat Class Updates**

```python
class ClinicalTrialChatMCP:
    def __init__(self, openai_api_key: str, model: str = "o3-mini"):
        """Initialize with reasoning model by default"""
        self.openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)
        self.model = model  # Default: o3-mini
```

### **New Reasoning Tools**

```

### **Enhanced System Prompt**

```python
def _create_system_prompt(self) -> str:
    return """You are a Clinical Trial Analysis Assistant powered by OpenAI's reasoning models (o3-mini by default)...

**Reasoning Model Capabilities:**
- o3-mini: Fast reasoning model for complex queries (default)
- o3: Most powerful reasoning model for expert analysis
- Both models excel at understanding complex clinical trial queries

When users ask complex questions about clinical trials, prefer using the reasoning_query tool with o3-mini for the best balance of speed and accuracy. For expert-level analysis, use o3 model."""
```

## üìä **Query Processing Flow**

### **Step 1: Natural Language Input**
```
User: "Compare Phase 3 trials for metastatic bladder cancer using different checkpoint inhibitors"
```

### **Step 2: Reasoning Model Analysis**
```python
# o3-mini analyzes the query
analyzer = ClinicalTrialAnalyzerReasoning(api_key, model="o3-mini")
analysis_result = analyzer.analyze_query(query)

# Extracted information:
{
    "query_intent": "compare Phase 3 clinical trials... that use different immune checkpoint inhibitors",
    "confidence_score": 0.95,
    "filters": {
        "indication": "metastatic bladder cancer",
        "trial_phase": "Phase 3",
        "primary_drug": "checkpoint inhibitors"
    },
    "search_strategy": "Multi-step database search with comparative analysis focus"
}
```

### **Step 3: Database Search**
```python
# Search trials based on extracted filters
results = db.search_trials(filters, limit=20)
```

### **Step 4: AI Analysis & Response**
```python
# Format comprehensive response with AI insights
response = f"üß† **Reasoning Query Analysis** (using {reasoning_model})\n\n"
response += f"**Query:** {query}\n"
response += f"**Intent:** {analysis_result.get('query_intent')}\n"
response += f"**Confidence:** {analysis_result.get('confidence_score')}\n"
response += f"**Found {len(results)} trials:**\n"
# ... detailed trial information
```

## üéØ **Usage Examples**

### **Complex Comparison Query**
```python
chat = ClinicalTrialChatMCP(api_key, model="o3-mini")

response = chat.chat("Compare Phase 3 trials for metastatic bladder cancer using different checkpoint inhibitors")

# Response includes:
# - Query interpretation with confidence score
# - Extracted filters and search strategy
# - Found trials with details
# - AI analysis and insights
