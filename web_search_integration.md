# Web Search Integration for Clinical Trial Analysis

## Overview

We've enhanced the Clinical Trial Analysis system by integrating web search capabilities for the `o3` model. This allows the analyzer to find up-to-date information about drugs, mechanisms of action, biomarkers, and other clinical trial details that may not be fully described in the trial data itself.

## Key Changes

### 1. Default Web Search for o3 Model

- The `analyze_trial` method now accepts a `use_web_search` parameter (default: `True`)
- When using the `o3` model with web search enabled, the system automatically uses the `analyze_trial_with_web_search` method
- This ensures that all analyses with the `o3` model benefit from web search by default

### 2. Enhanced Web Search Prompt

- The web search prompt has been significantly expanded with detailed instructions
- The prompt now includes specific sections for each category of fields to extract
- Clear instructions for using web search to find additional information about:
  - Drug mechanisms of action, targets, and modalities
  - Disease indications and standard treatment approaches
  - Biomarkers and their significance
  - Sponsor companies and their drug development pipelines

### 3. Improved Error Handling

- Added robust error handling throughout the web search integration
- Graceful fallback to legacy methods if web search fails
- Comprehensive logging of web search results and errors

### 4. Multi-Row Analysis with Web Search

- Updated `analyze_trial_multi_row` to use web search for the `o3` model
- Ensures that all analyses, including those that split into multiple rows, benefit from web search

### 5. Batch Processing Support

- Updated `process_all_trials.py` to automatically use web search for the `o3` model
- This ensures that batch processing of multiple trials also benefits from web search

## Benefits

1. **More Complete Information**: Web search provides access to up-to-date information about drugs, mechanisms, and biomarkers that may not be fully described in the trial data.

2. **Higher Quality Analysis**: By supplementing the trial data with information from the web, the analyzer can provide more accurate and comprehensive analysis.

3. **Better Context**: Web search allows the analyzer to understand the broader context of the trial, including the sponsor's drug development pipeline and the standard treatment approaches for the indication.

4. **Improved Accuracy**: Access to current information about drug mechanisms and biomarkers leads to more accurate field extraction and classification.

## Usage

Web search is now enabled by default for the `o3` model. To use it:

```python
# Web search is used automatically for o3 model
analyzer = ClinicalTrialAnalyzerReasoning(api_key, model="o3")
result = analyzer.analyze_trial("NCT12345678")

# To disable web search explicitly
result = analyzer.analyze_trial("NCT12345678", use_web_search=False)
```

The analysis results will include a field `analysis_method` set to `"web_search"` when web search was used, allowing for easy identification of analyses that benefited from web search.
