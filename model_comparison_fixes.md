# Model Comparison Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **All Model Analyses Failed**: The model comparison feature was failing with the error "‚ùå All model analyses failed!"

2. **Error Handling**: The code wasn't properly handling errors during the analysis process, causing all comparisons to fail.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**: The fallback mechanism wasn't being applied correctly when the API analysis failed.

4. **Missing Debug Information**: There was insufficient logging to identify the root cause of failures.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `analyze_trial_with_model`

- **Structured Error Handling**: Added multiple try-except blocks to handle different types of errors at different stages:
  - Trial data loading errors
  - Analysis errors
  - Fallback application errors

- **Complete Fallback Mechanism**: Implemented a complete fallback path when analysis fails:
  - Creates an `AnalysisResult` object directly from fallback data
  - Uses trial-specific information even when the API call fails completely

- **Improved Error Messages**: Added more descriptive error messages to help diagnose issues

### 2. Added Debugging Information to `run_model_comparison`

- **Step-by-Step Logging**: Added logging for each stage of the comparison process
- **Model-Specific Error Reporting**: Shows detailed errors for each model that fails
- **Result Counting**: Reports how many analyses succeeded vs. failed
- **Exception Handling**: Catches and reports exceptions during the analysis process

### 3. Fixed Import Issues

- **Proper Import of `AnalysisResult`**: Ensured the `AnalysisResult` class is properly imported from the correct module
- **Removed Duplicate Imports**: Fixed duplicate imports that could cause conflicts

### 4. Improved Fallback Quality

- **Selective Value Updates**: Only updates fields with fallback values when the fallback value is better than "N/A"
- **Analysis Method Tracking**: Updates the `analysis_method` field to indicate when fallback was used
- **Comprehensive Fallback Data**: Includes all available fields from the fallback mechanism

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Comparisons**: Model comparisons now work reliably even when some models fail
2. **Better Diagnostics**: Detailed error messages help identify and fix issues
3. **Graceful Degradation**: The system falls back to available data when the API fails
4. **Transparent Process**: Users can see which parts of the analysis used fallback data
5. **Consistent Results**: All models produce comparable results even with different capabilities

## Usage

The model comparison feature now works as expected:

1. Select multiple models to compare
2. Enter an NCT ID
3. Click "Run Model Comparison"
4. View the comprehensive comparison table
5. Download the results as CSV

If any models fail, the system will show detailed error messages and still complete the comparison with the successful models.
