# Clinical Trial MCP Server and Chat Interface Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Python Path and Import Issues

**Problem:** The MCP server and chat interface were failing with import errors when run from different directories.

**Solution:**
- Added code to properly set up the Python path in both MCP server and chat interface files
- Modified import statements to use the correct paths with the `src` prefix
- Created convenience scripts (`run_mcp_chat.py` and `run_mcp_server.py`) that ensure the Python path is set correctly

### 2. QueryAnalysisResult Object Access

**Problem:** The code was trying to access the QueryAnalysisResult object using dictionary-style access with `.get()` method, but it's a Pydantic model that should be accessed using attribute access.

**Solution:**
- Changed all instances of `analysis_result.get('filters', {})` to `analysis_result.filters`
- Changed all instances of `analysis_result.get('query_intent', 'N/A')` to `analysis_result.query_intent`
- Changed all instances of `analysis_result.get('confidence_score', 0.0)` to `analysis_result.confidence_score`
- Changed all instances of `analysis_result.get('search_strategy', 'N/A')` to `analysis_result.search_strategy`

### 3. Enhanced Documentation

- Created `MCP_README.md` with comprehensive instructions on how to run the MCP server and chat interface
- Added example queries to demonstrate the semantic search capabilities
- Included troubleshooting tips for common issues

## Running the Fixed Code

### Option 1: Using the Convenience Scripts (Recommended)

We've created convenience scripts that ensure the Python path is set up correctly:

1. To run the chat interface:
   ```
   python run_mcp_chat.py
   ```

2. To run the MCP server directly:
   ```
   python run_mcp_server.py
   ```

### Option 2: Running from the Project Root

You can also run the modules directly from the project root:

1. To run the chat interface:
   ```
   python src/mcp/clinical_trial_chat_mcp.py
   ```

2. To run the MCP server directly:
   ```
   python src/mcp/clinical_trial_mcp_server.py
   ```

## Testing the Semantic Search

The chat interface now supports advanced semantic search using natural language queries:

- "Find trials using semaglutide"
- "What trials exist for metastatic triple-negative breast cancer?"
- "Find trials combining checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy for lung cancer"
- "Trials for EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer"
- "Compare the efficacy endpoints in trials of PARP inhibitors for ovarian cancer"
- "Analyze trends in immunotherapy trials for solid tumors"
