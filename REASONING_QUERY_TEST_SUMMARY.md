- **Simple Queries**: Use `gpt-4o` for basic searches

**For This Specific Query:**
- **o3-mini** provides the best overall performance
- **o3** offers the most detailed analysis approach
- Both reasoning models significantly outperform the standard model

## 🚀 **MCP Server Integration**

The reasoning models are now properly integrated into the MCP server with:

### **Available Tools:**
1. **`reasoning_query`**: Direct reasoning model queries
2. **`compare_analysis`**: AI-powered trial comparisons
3. **`trend_analysis`**: Pattern recognition and trend analysis

### **Usage Example:**
```python
{
    "tool": "reasoning_query",
    "arguments": {
        "query": "Compare Phase 3 trials for metastatic bladder cancer using different checkpoint inhibitors",
        "reasoning_model": "o3-mini",
        "include_analysis": true,
        "format": "detailed"
    }
}
```
